                <h2>💡 Strategies by Question Type</h2>

                <h3>Hash Table</h3>
                <p><strong>When to use:</strong> Look for problems that involve lookups, checking for duplicates, or
                    counting frequencies. If you need to quickly check for the existence of a value, a hash table (or
                    hash set) is often the most efficient tool.</p>
                <p><strong>Strategy:</strong> The core idea is to trade space for time. By using extra memory to store
                    data in a hash table, you can achieve O(1) average time complexity for insertions, deletions, and
                    lookups. For "Two Sum," we store numbers and their indices to find the complement in constant time.
                </p>
                <div class="code-block">
                    <pre><code># General Structure for Hash Table lookups
hash_map = {}
for item in data:
    # Check if a complement/related item exists
    if (target - item) in hash_map:
        # Found a solution, do something
        return [hash_map[target - item], item]
    # Add current item to map for future lookups
    hash_map[item] = index</code></pre>
                </div>

                <h3>Two Pointers</h3>
                <p><strong>When to use:</strong> This pattern is ideal for problems involving sorted arrays or linked
                    lists where you need to find a pair of elements that meet certain criteria. It's also great for
                    finding palindromes or reversing sequences.</p>
                <p><strong>Strategy:</strong> Use two pointers that move through the data structure. They can start from
                    opposite ends and move towards each other (like in "Container With Most Water"), or one can be a
                    "fast" pointer and the other "slow" (like in "Linked List Cycle"). This avoids nested loops and
                    often leads to an O(n) solution.</p>
                <div class="code-block">
                    <pre><code># General Structure for Two Pointers (from ends)
left, right = 0, len(array) - 1
while left < right:
    # Do some logic with array[left] and array[right]
    if condition_met(array[left], array[right]):
        # Move one of the pointers
        left += 1
    else:
        # Move the other pointer
        right -= 1</code></pre>
                </div>

                <h3>Sliding Window</h3>
                <p><strong>When to use:</strong> For problems that ask for the longest/shortest/best subarray or
                    substring that satisfies a condition. Think "Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters" or
                    "Minimum Window Substring."</p>
                <p><strong>Strategy:</strong> Define a "window" with two pointers, `left` and `right`. Expand the window
                    by moving `right`. When the window no longer meets the criteria, shrink it from the left by moving
                    `left`. This is much more efficient than generating all possible subarrays, usually resulting in
                    O(n) time complexity.</p>
                <div class="code-block">
                    <pre><code># General Structure for Sliding Window
left = 0
result = 0
for right in range(len(array)):
    # Add array[right] to the window state

    # While the window is invalid...
    while window_is_invalid:
        # Remove array[left] from the window state
        left += 1

    # Update result with the valid window
    result = max(result, right - left + 1)</code></pre>
                </div>

                <h3>Linked List</h3>
                <p><strong>When to use:</strong> Problems that explicitly involve linked list manipulation, such as
                    reversal, merging, cycle detection, or removing nodes.</p>
                <p><strong>Strategy:</strong> Keep track of `head`, `current`, `previous`, and `next` nodes carefully. A
                    dummy head node can simplify edge cases for insertions or deletions at the beginning of the list.
                    For cycle detection, the fast/slow pointer approach is classic. For reversals, you'll need to juggle
                    pointers to reverse the links iteratively.</p>
                <div class="code-block">
                    <pre><code># General Structure for Linked List traversal
current = head
while current:
    # Do something with current.val
    current = current.next</code></pre>
                </div>

                <h3>Tree / DFS / BFS</h3>
                <p><strong>When to use:</strong> Any problem involving a tree or graph structure. Common tasks include
                    traversal, finding paths, calculating depth/height, or level-order operations.</p>
                <p><strong>Strategy:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>DFS (Depth-First Search):</strong> Goes deep down one path before exploring others. It's
                        often implemented with recursion or an explicit stack. Great for pathfinding, checking
                        connectivity, and problems where you need to explore all possibilities in a branch.</li>
                    <li><strong>BFS (Breadth-First Search):</strong> Explores level by level. It's implemented with a
                        queue. Perfect for finding the shortest path in an unweighted graph/tree and for level-order
                        traversals.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <div class="code-block">
                    <pre><code># General Structure for DFS (Recursive)
def dfs(node):
    if not node:
        return
    # Pre-order logic here
    dfs(node.left)
    # In-order logic here
    dfs(node.right)
    # Post-order logic here

# General Structure for BFS
from collections import deque
def bfs(root):
    queue = deque([root])
    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        # Process node
        if node.left: queue.append(node.left)
        if node.right: queue.append(node.right)</code></pre>
                </div>

                <h3>Dynamic Programming (DP)</h3>
                <p><strong>When to use:</strong> Look for problems asking for the optimal (max/min/longest/shortest) way
                    to do something, where the problem can be broken down into overlapping subproblems. "Climbing
                    Stairs," "Coin Change," and "Longest Increasing Subsequence" are classic DP examples.</p>
                <p><strong>Strategy:</strong>
                <ol>
                    <li><strong>Identify Subproblems:</strong> Define `dp[i]` or `dp[i][j]` to represent the solution
                        for a smaller version of the problem.</li>
                    <li><strong>Find the Recurrence Relation:</strong> Figure out how to solve `dp[i]` using the
                        solutions to previous subproblems (e.g., `dp[i-1]`, `dp[i-2]`).</li>
                    <li><strong>Identify Base Cases:</strong> Determine the solution for the smallest subproblems (e.g.,
                        `dp[0]`, `dp[1]`).</li>
                </ol>
                You can solve it using memoization (top-down recursion with caching) or tabulation (bottom-up
                iteration).
                </p>
                <div class="code-block">
                    <pre><code># General Structure for DP (Tabulation, 1D)
dp = [0] * (n + 1)
# Base cases
dp[0] = 1
# Fill the DP table using the recurrence relation
for i in range(1, n + 1):
    dp[i] = dp[i-1] + dp[i-2] # e.g., Fibonacci
return dp[n]</code></pre>
                </div>

                <h3>Backtracking</h3>
                <p><strong>When to use:</strong> Problems that ask for all possible solutions or combinations, like
                    "Generate Parentheses," "Permutations," and "Subsets."</p>
                <p><strong>Strategy:</strong> This is a form of recursion. Build a solution step by step. At each step,
                    explore all valid choices. If a choice leads to a dead end, "backtrack" by undoing the choice and
                    trying another. A helper function with the current state (e.g., the current permutation being built)
                    is a common pattern.</p>
                <div class="code-block">
                    <pre><code># General Structure for Backtracking
def backtrack(current_state, ...):
    if solution_found(current_state):
        add_solution_to_results()
        return

    for choice in possible_choices:
        # 1. Choose: Add choice to state
        current_state.add(choice)
        # 2. Explore: Recurse with new state
        backtrack(current_state, ...)
        # 3. Unchoose: Remove choice to backtrack
        current_state.remove(choice)</code></pre>

                <h2>🧑‍💻 Example Walkthroughs</h2>

                <h3>1. Hash Table: Two Sum (#1)</h3>
                <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Given an array of integers `nums` and a `target`, return indices of the two
                    numbers that add up to `target`.</p>
                <p><strong>Strategy:</strong> This is a classic <strong>Hash Table</strong> problem. We iterate through
                    the array once, storing each number and its index in a hash map. For each number, we calculate its
                    complement (`target - num`) and check if the complement already exists in the map. If it does, we've
                    found our pair.</p>
                <div class="code-block">
                    <pre><code>class Solution:
    def twoSum(self, nums: list[int], target: int) -> list[int]:
        num_map = {}
        for i, num in enumerate(nums):
            complement = target - num
            if complement in num_map:
                return [num_map[complement], i]
            num_map[num] = i</code></pre>
                </div>

                <h3 class="mt-8">2. Sliding Window: Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters (#3)</h3>
                <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Given a string `s`, find the length of the longest substring without
                    repeating characters.</p>
                <p><strong>Strategy:</strong> This is a perfect problem for the <strong>Sliding Window</strong>
                    technique. We use two pointers, `left` and `right`, to define our window, and a set to track
                    characters in the window. We expand the window by moving `right`. If we find a character that's
                    already in the set, we shrink the window from the left until the duplicate is gone. We continuously
                    update our max length.</p>
                <div class="code-block">
                    <pre><code>class Solution:
    def lengthOfLongestSubstring(self, s: str) -> int:
        char_set = set()
        left = 0
        max_length = 0
        for right in range(len(s)):
            while s[right] in char_set:
                char_set.remove(s[left])
                left += 1
            char_set.add(s[right])
            max_length = max(max_length, right - left + 1)
        return max_length</code></pre>
                </div>

                <h3 class="mt-8">3. Two Pointers: Container With Most Water (#11)</h3>
                <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Given an array of non-negative integers representing heights, find two
                    lines that together with the x-axis form a container, such that the container contains the most
                    water.</p>
                <p><strong>Strategy:</strong> Use the <strong>Two Pointers</strong> pattern. Start with one pointer at
                    the beginning (`left`) and one at the end (`right`). Calculate the area. The area is limited by the
                    shorter of the two lines. To potentially find a larger area, you must move the pointer of the
                    shorter line inward, because moving the taller line's pointer can't increase the height and will
                    only decrease the width.</p>
                <div class="code-block">
                    <pre><code>class Solution:
    def maxArea(self, height: list[int]) -> int:

            h = min(height[left], height[right])

            max_area = max(max_area, h * w)
            if height[left] < height[right]:

                <h3 class="mt-8">4. Linked List: Reverse Linked List (#206)</h3>
                <p><strong>Problem:</strong> Given the `head` of a singly linked list, reverse the list, and return the
                    reversed list's head.</p>
                <p><strong>Strategy:</strong> This is a fundamental <strong>Linked List</strong> manipulation. You
                    iterate through the list, and for each node, you reverse its `next` pointer to point to the
                    `previous` node. You'll need three pointers: `prev` (starts as `None`), `curr` (starts as `head`),
                    and a `next_temp` to hold the next node before you overwrite the pointer.</p>
                <div class="code-block">
                    <pre><code># Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:

class Solution:
    def reverseList(self, head: ListNode) -> ListNode:

                <p><strong>Problem:</strong> You are climbing a staircase. It takes `n` steps to reach the top. Each
                    time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?</p>
                <p><strong>Strategy:</strong> This is a classic <strong>Dynamic Programming</strong> problem. The number
                    of ways to get to step `n` is the sum of the ways to get to step `n-1` (and taking one step) and the
                    ways to get to step `n-2` (and taking two steps). This is the Fibonacci sequence. We can build a DP
                    array where `dp[i]` stores the number of ways to reach step `i`.</p>

                    combinations of well-formed parentheses.</p>
                <p><strong>Strategy:</strong> Use <strong>Backtracking</strong>. We build the string from left to right.
                    We can add an opening parenthesis if we haven't used all `n` of them. We can add a closing
                    parenthesis if it wouldn't exceed the number of open parentheses already placed. We recurse until
                    the string length is `2*n`.</p>

                <p><strong>Problem:</strong> You are given an integer array `nums` sorted in ascending order, and it has

                    sorted. Then, check if the `target` lies within the range of that sorted half. If it does, search

                    or if the top of the stack is the corresponding opening bracket. If it is, pop the stack. If not,
