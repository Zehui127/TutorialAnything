                    <h2>Welcome to the World of Statistical Genomics üß¨</h2>
                    <p>
                        Statistical genomics is an exciting, interdisciplinary field that sits at the intersection of <strong>genetics</strong>, <strong>statistics</strong>, and <strong>computer science</strong>. Its primary goal is to develop and apply statistical methods to understand the vast amount of data generated by modern genomic technologies.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        From finding the genetic basis of diseases like cancer and diabetes to understanding how gene expression patterns change during development, statistical genomics provides the tools to turn raw biological data into meaningful insights. This site will guide you through the core concepts, key analytical methods, and essential tools you'll need to get started.

                    <h2>üî¨ Core Concepts</h2>
                    
                    <h3>Genomic Data Types</h3>
                    <p>The field works with various types of high-throughput sequencing data:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>DNA-Seq:</strong> Used for identifying genetic variants like Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) and structural variants. Includes Whole Genome Sequencing (WGS) and Whole Exome Sequencing (WES).</li>
                        <li><strong>RNA-Seq:</strong> Measures the expression levels of thousands of genes simultaneously by sequencing the RNA molecules in a sample. Essential for understanding cellular function and state.</li>
                        <li><strong>ChIP-Seq:</strong> Helps identify binding sites of DNA-associated proteins, revealing insights into gene regulation and epigenetic modifications.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h3>Statistical Foundations</h3>
                    <p>A solid understanding of these statistical principles is crucial:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Probability & Distributions:</strong> Understanding the likelihood of events (e.g., binomial, Poisson, normal distributions).</li>
                        <li><strong>Hypothesis Testing:</strong> The framework for making statistical decisions (e.g., t-tests, chi-squared tests). The concepts of p-values and false discovery rates (FDR) are central.</li>
                        <li><strong>Linear & Generalized Linear Models:</strong> Used to model relationships between genetic variants (or gene expression) and traits of interest.</li>
                        <li><strong>High-Dimensional Data:</strong> Genomic datasets are often "high-dimensional," meaning you have many more variables (genes, SNPs) than samples. This requires specialized techniques for analysis and multiple testing correction.</li>

                    <h3>1. Genome-Wide Association Studies (GWAS)</h3>
                    <p><strong>Question:</strong> Which genetic variants across the entire genome are associated with a particular disease or trait?</p>
                    <p><strong>Method:</strong> A GWAS tests millions of SNPs one by one for an association with a trait of interest (e.g., case vs. control status for a disease). A statistical test (like a chi-squared test or logistic regression) is performed for each SNP, resulting in a p-value.</p>
                    <p><strong>Visualization: The Manhattan Plot.</strong> This plot displays all the p-values on a genomic scale. The x-axis shows the genomic position by chromosome, and the y-axis shows the -log10(p-value). A higher point means a stronger statistical association (lower p-value). A genome-wide significance threshold (typically 5x10‚Åª‚Å∏, shown as a red line) is used to declare significant "hits."</p>

                    <h3>2. RNA-Seq Differential Expression Analysis</h3>
                    <p><strong>Question:</strong> Which genes show a significant change in expression level between two conditions (e.g., treated vs. untreated cells)?</p>
                    <p><strong>Method:</strong> RNA-Seq data starts as read counts per gene. These counts are modeled using a distribution like the negative binomial. Packages like DESeq2 or edgeR use this to perform statistical tests that account for variance and library size, producing a p-value and a log2(Fold Change) for each gene.</p>
                    <p><strong>Visualization: The Volcano Plot.</strong> This plot is a powerful way to see the results. The x-axis is the log2(Fold Change), indicating the magnitude of change. The y-axis is the -log10(p-value), indicating the statistical significance. Genes in the top-left and top-right corners are both statistically significant and have a large magnitude of change, making them the most interesting candidates.</p>

                    <h3>1. GWAS Case Study: Understanding Disease Association</h3>
                    <h4>Sample Question:</h4>
                    <p>You are given a Manhattan plot from a GWAS of schizophrenia. You observe a strong peak of SNPs on chromosome 6 that cross the genome-wide significance line. What is your initial conclusion, and what would be your immediate next step?</p>
                    
                    <div class="solution-box">
                        <h4>Solution:</h4>
                        <p><strong>Conclusion:</strong> The SNPs in the peak on chromosome 6 are significantly associated with schizophrenia. This region of the genome likely contains one or more genes that influence the risk of developing the disorder.</p>
                        <p><strong>Next Step:</strong> The immediate next step is to perform fine-mapping and annotation of this region. You would use tools like the UCSC Genome Browser to identify which genes are located near these significant SNPs. This helps generate hypotheses about which specific gene's function might be altered by these variants.</p>

                    <h3>2. Differential Expression Case Study: Identifying Cancer-Related Genes</h3>
                    <h4>Sample Question:</h4>
                    <p>In a volcano plot comparing a tumor sample to a normal tissue sample, you identify a gene with a log2(Fold Change) of +4 and an adjusted p-value of 1x10‚Åª¬π‚Å∞. You also see a gene with a log2(Fold Change) of +0.5 and an adjusted p-value of 0.04. Which gene is a more promising candidate for follow-up studies, and why?</p>

                     <div class="solution-box">
                        <h4>Solution:</h4>
                        <p>The gene with a log2(Fold Change) of +4 and a p-value of 1x10‚Åª¬π‚Å∞ is the far more promising candidate. Here's why:</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>Magnitude of Change:</strong> A log2(Fold Change) of +4 means the gene's expression is 16 times higher (2‚Å¥ = 16) in the tumor sample. This is a very large biological effect.</li>
                            <li><strong>Statistical Significance:</strong> An adjusted p-value of 1x10‚Åª¬π‚Å∞ is extremely significant, indicating a very low probability that this result is due to random chance.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>The second gene, while statistically significant (p < 0.05), has a very small effect size (only 1.4x higher expression) and is barely below the significance threshold. The first gene represents a much stronger and more robust biological signal.</p>
